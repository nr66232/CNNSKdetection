## General Information
- The model uses International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dataset of skin lesion images for various skin diseases.
- CNN models can be used effectively as screening tools for skin cancers, this reducing the manual effort & delay in first level detection.

-The data set contains the following diseases:

	Actinic keratosis
	Basal cell carcinoma
	Dermatofibroma
	Melanoma
	Nevus
	Pigmented benign keratosis
	Seborrheic keratosis
	Squamous cell carcinoma
	Vascular lesion
-No pre-trained model is used

## Conclusions
- Adding dropout layers helps in reducing overfitting
- Using augmentor tools to increase the sample size results in better data imbalance & improved accuracy
